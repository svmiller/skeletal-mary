# A Random Item Response Model of External Territorial Threat, 1816-2010

Multiple scholars have shown that external territorial threat,
conceptually the level of concern for a state that its territorial
integrity is subject to violent conflict and imposed contraction by
other states, has major implications for the state’s domestic political
environment. However, the strand of scholarship that agrees on the
domestic political effects of external territorial threat disagrees on
how to code this important concept. These works either rely on binary
indicators that do a poor job communicating ‘’increasing’’ or
‘’decreasing’’ territorial threat, or use dyad-year indicators of
conflict propensities as a stand-in for a state-year-level observation.
I use this research note to offer an empirical measurement of state-year
external territorial threat from a Bayesian random item response model
for all states from 1816 to 2010. I assess the face validity and
construct validity of the data these models generate, all of which
suggest the measure does well to capture the concept in question. I
close with a statement of the availability of the data and its potential
applications.

## An Explanation for This Repository’s Name

[I got tired of the peer-review
process](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller/status/1229788167223398400)
changing the names of my projects. When this happened, my repository
names would no longer make sense. [I started creating nicknames for my
projects](https://twitter.com/stevenvmiller/status/1229788168049676294)
at the project’s onset, using either the Ubuntu Name Generator or the
Wu-Tang Name Generator. This led to the creation of an R
package—[`{codename}`](https://github.com/svmiller/codename)—that would
do this for me. This is what came out for this project.

``` r
library(codename)

codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename::variety_pack("A Random Item Response Model of External Territorial Threat, 1816-2010")
#> [1] "bright blue barbiturate"
#> [1] "skeletal mary"
#> [1] "sapphire stoat"
#> [1] "Respected Killah"
```

`type = "gods"` for the win. “skeletal mary” it is.
