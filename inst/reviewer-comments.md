## "First, a minor note: the author creates two indices: (1) the first starts with politically relevant dyads targeted by a territorial claim; (2) the second starts with strategic rivalry data.  Table 2 indicates that these two indices can be subsetted from the primary latent measure.  This could have been made a little clearer for the reader (perhaps on Page 4, in which this is described)."

I'm not sure I do that, but let me look into this.

## Describe potential hypotheses to be tested with the data. Expand the appeal. Hit more of a home run at the end.

## Explore potential collinearity in Table 2

In other words, is my measure correlated with the other stuff in that model? This is an appendix issue.

## Specifically, I think the "who cares" question needs some additional work. 

"Before these can be address, though, a kind of "big picture" discussion would seem warranted.  This, too, will help expand the article's appeal.  If space becomes a concern, perhaps there is material that could be shifted into an appendix (some of the replications, for example)."

# CONCEPTUALIZATION

## is this subjective or objective?

For instance, the manuscript offers an initial definition of the concept as “the level of concern that the state’s territorial integrity is subject to violent conflict…” (p. 1). Similarly, p. 4 makes reference to the manner in which distance might impact “perceived threat.” These descriptions leave ambiguous whose level of concern is the focus of the concept. Does the concept focus on the state’s own subjective sense of threat, or is the focus on a more objective estimate of the probability the state will be targeted?

# EMPIRICS

## The starting point for the data is dyadic, so why is it monadic?

The starting point for creating the data are dyadic, but includes some monadic stuff as well for a measure that's ultimately monadic. I think this is more of a clarification issue. Should more monadic stuff be included? Like number of ongoing conflicts? How many rivalries a state is involved in? How many PRDs are there? My answer here is ultimately no, but i'm going to have to explain this.

## Why use the categorical distance scale?

I can explain this, but I have to offer a complement here with the minimum distance measure that just expanded to 1816.

## Rethink the interactive effect, given Brambor et al. and shit.

I'm going to run out of space, but I can do this.

## MINOR: Clarify meaning of 0 in Figure 1

"Does the scale of the territorial threat variable have any meaning? In other words, can/should the reader infer anything when the values of the scale cross from positive to negative, as happens in Figure 1 around 1980? Or is the scale simply arbitrary with 0 not indicating anything particularly important?"
